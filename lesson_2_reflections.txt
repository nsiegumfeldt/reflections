git init initializes a git repository with no commits.
This enables version control of that folder.

the difference between the staging area and the working directory is that it is the
blueprint for what is to be committed.
This gives the user more control of what he commits, before he commits it.

You can use the staging area to make sure you have only one commit per logical change,
by only committing the files that are impacted by the changed described in the commit
message.

is git branch to make new track of changes that you can later merge with your master
branch.

Using git merge to merge branches automatically adds new lines, deletes lines that 
aren't in conflict and highlights areas with conflicts.
Automatically adding new and removing lines can be fast, but runs the risk of 
delivering buggy code.
